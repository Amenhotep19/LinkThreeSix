Player 1: Blue X'sPlayer 2: Red O's

Your objective is to make links of 3 in a row, or more. Links can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Link Scoring:
3 in a row: 1 point
4 in a row: 3 points
5 in a row: 10 points
6 in a row: 20 points

The game is scored in real time, after every move. The Game Score board highlights the current game leader.

After each game, the Total Wins board updates to reflect the winner of the current game, and keeps track of the entire match.

The first player to win 3 single games, wins the match!
